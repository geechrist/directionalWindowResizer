The idea behind this plugin is to allow users to resize windows by using the Ctrl key (or something else the user may choose) + whatever they have assigned to  <down> <up> <left> & <right> which by default is obviously jkhl.

Therefore, by default, the windows adjustment functions in directionalWindowResizer.vim are  set to <Ctrl+j> for down, <Ctrl+k> for up, <Ctrl+l> for right & <Ctrl +h> for left
These mappings are at the very top of the file, adjust them to whatever suits your needs

The behaviour of it is as follows:
Whatever window is currently selected is the window that is going to be resized. 
Ctrl j - if bottom most window selected, window size is reduced by 1
          - for all other windows the bottom border is pushed downwards by 1
Ctrl k - if top most window selected, window size is reduced by 1
           - for all other windows the top border is pushed upwards by 1
Ctrl l - if right most window selected, window size is reduced by 1
          - for all other windows the right border is pushed to the right by 1
Ctrl h - if left most window selected, window size is reduced by 1
           - for all other windows the left border is pushed to the left by 1

If you only have 1 window or if you only have vertically split windows Ctrl j & 
Ctrl k will not work Â– ie if you only have vertical splits why would you want to reduce all their sizes?  Similarily if you only have 1 window or you only have horizontally split windows Ctrl l & Ctrl h won't work either.
